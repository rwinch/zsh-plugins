= copy

A simple zsh plugin that provides a `copy` alias for copying text to the clipboard on Linux systems.

== Overview

This plugin creates a convenient `copy` alias that pipes output to the X11 clipboard using `xclip`. It's designed for Linux systems using X11 and provides a simple, memorable command for clipboard operations.

== Features

* Simple `copy` alias for clipboard operations
* Uses `xclip` with the clipboard selection (not just primary selection)
* Works with piped input
* Consistent with macOS's `pbcopy` command pattern

== Installation

Can be installed using antigen:

[source,bash]
----
antigen bundle rwinch/zsh-plugins/copy
----

Or manually by sourcing the plugin file in your `.zshrc`:

[source,bash]
----
source /path/to/copy/copy.plugin.zsh
----

== Usage

Pipe any text output to the `copy` command:

[source,bash]
----
echo "text to copy" | copy
cat file.txt | copy
pwd | copy
git log --oneline -1 | copy
----

== Requirements

* Linux system with X11
* `xclip` must be installed

To install `xclip`:

[source,bash]
----
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install xclip

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install xclip

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S xclip
----

== Technical Details

The alias expands to:

[source,bash]
----
alias copy='xclip -selection clipboard'
----

This uses the `clipboard` selection (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V) rather than the `primary` selection (middle-click paste).
